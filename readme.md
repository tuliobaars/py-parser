# pdf-crawler

A more robust solution should be created in order to make this 
available for the production environment. Currently we just have some tests to check if we can crawl [the page](http://balancos.imprensaoficial.com.br/Condiario.asp).

It seems that is possible to crawl the page, but the computacional cost seems to be high.
